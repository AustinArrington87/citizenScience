# citizenScience
Python scripts for citizen science projects involving data mining and image analysis. 

imgScrape/imgScrape.py scrapes images from the Flickr API using bounding box, keyword, time and other filter parameters. Images are saved to the users working directory and a CSV is output with image metadata. 

hueScraper.py scrapes images and then converts all images into Hue Sturation Brightness values. 

These scripts can be utilized for mining and analyzing images of the natural world through citizen science. Have fun!
